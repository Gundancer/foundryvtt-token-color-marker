# Token Color Marker
This is a module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop to add a color marker to a token. This allows for easy identification if a token has the same image.

This module works for the "DnD5e", "Pathfinder 1", and "Pathfinder Second Edition" systems. It also works for the "worldbuilding" system so it may work for other systems not mentioned here.

## Installation

Module JSON:

```
https://github.com/Gundancer/foundryvtt-token-color-marker/releases/latest/download/module.json
```

## Usage
Token Color Marker works in a similar  way to assigning a status effect. Open the color marker palette and select a color as shown bellow.

Remove a color marker by selecting it again from the color marker palette. Multiple color markers can be applied at once.

Token Color Marker comes with some module settings. The Token Color Marker button can be disabled so it no longer shows on the token. The button can be set to only display for the GM. The GM can also create new and modify existing color markers.

The "My Color Setting" button in module settings will open the color customization window. The name of a color marker can be modified here along with the hex value. The color picker shows the color and opens to a color picker. The image below is an example of adding "Pink" to the color marker palette.
